                                <p>How can irony be defined? It is the art of saying something while meaning its
                                    opposite — a delicate balance between <i>appearance</i> and <i>reality</i>. But
                                    irony is also a
                                    deeply <b><span style="color: #d31abbeb;">creative act</span></b>: it relies on
                                    imagination, interpretation, and shared
                                    understanding between the <i>ironist</i> and the <i>observer</i>. This ontology aims
                                    to map that
                                    creative tension, revealing how irony emerges, evolves, and connects minds through
                                    layers of meaning.</p>

                    <p>We chose irony as the focus of our project because it is a complex, elusive, and deeply
                        relational concept. What makes it especially intriguing is its inherent <b>duality</b>, the
                        constant coexistence and tension between two layers of meaning: <i>appearance</i> and
                        <i>reality</i>, the
                        literal and the implied. This friction between what is said and what is meant is what we call
                        <b><i>clash</i></b>, which becomes a fertile ground for creativity.
                    </p>
                    <p>Building an ontology about <b>irony in lyrical works</b> allowed us to make this
                        dual structure visible, as their
                        concise form offers an ideal ground for showing clearly such delicate balance.</p>
                    <p>In our view, <b>irony is a form of creativity in which both the <i>ironist</i> and the
                            <i>observer</i>
                            participate as co-creators</b>. Irony is not a solitary act but a shared artistic process:
                        its meaning emerges only through the interplay between the one who produces it and the one who
                        perceives it. The ironist shapes the ambiguity, but it is the observer that completes the act by
                        recognizing the <i>clash</i> and finally interpreting it. Without a silent agreement between the
                        two
                        parts, irony wouldn't be possible. <br> This
                        collaborative creation is precisely what makes irony
                        fascinating to represent within an ontology: it is an attempt to map not only the structure of
                        meanings, but also their dynamic relationship that brings creativity to life.</p>

                    <h3 id="card2"><b>The Art of the Ironist: Perspectives</b></h3>
                    <p>Irony is notoriously difficult to define, as it is marked by a strong degree of subjectivity.
                        Attempts to confine such a broad concept within a structured framework have been numerous, and
                        the challenge is particularly acute in literature, where multiple forms of
                        irony have already been contextualized and analyzed by scholars in relation to different
                        authors.</p>
                    <p>In order to define and abstract the concept of irony, we reviewed various academic resources
                        focusing in on two closely related works: D. C. Muecke’s <i><a
                                href="https://www.taylorfrancis.com/books/mono/10.4324/9781003129905/compass-irony-muecke"
                                target="_blank">The
                                Compass of Irony</a></i> and Inés
                        Lozano-Palacio’s dissertation <i><a href="https://portalinvestigacion.uniovi.es/documentos/5ecd9f6c2999520eaa95156f"
                                target="_blank">A Scenario-Based Approach
                                to Irony. Structure, meaning and
                        function</a></i>, which itself draws heavily on Muecke’s framework. Both Muecke and Palacio approaches
                        irony in a structured and general way, unlike many other studies that focus on specific types of
                        irony — such as Socratic or Byronic irony — which tend to be more descriptive, practical, but
                        less conceptually coherent (for example, texts labeled as “Socratic” may not be written by
                        Socrates
                        himself, so it would first be necessary to clearly define what actually constitutes “Socratic
                        irony” — and what does not.) For this reason, we sought a more general and <b>abstract</b>
                        approach, capable of capturing the underlying mechanisms of irony rather than its manifestations
                        in particular styles or authors.
                    </p>

                    <p><b>To build the conceptual framework of our ontology</b>, we relied on Muecke’s analytical model
                        of irony, which provided a structured foundation for abstracting and classifying the phenomenon.
                    </p>

                    <p>As Muecke notes, <i><q>irony, like beauty, is in the eye of the beholder</q></i> — it
                        depends on an <b>ironist</b> that creates the premises for an <b>ironic event to happen</b>, and
                        an <b>observer</b> who is capable of perceiving the ironist's intentions behind their words.</p>

                                An ironist, therefore, is not just like an artist, but <b>is an artist</b>, governed by
                                the
                                artist's need for perfection of form and expression and all 'the nameless graces which

                                [...] And to have a sense of irony, to be able to see the ironic potential of a

                                state of affairs, is to have, among other qualities, something analogous to the artist's
                                ability
                                to see what would make a good picture or the writer's ability to see how an event could
                                be
                                turned into a good story.

                        </p>
                    </div>


                    <p>At the core of his framework lies the <b>principle of duality</b>, or <i>“double exposure”</i>,
                        between two levels of meaning:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><b>Level 1 (Appearance):</b> the literal meaning, the immediate perception, or the surface
                            intention of the ironist, which pretends to believe in what he is saying.</li>
                        <li><b>Level 2 (Reality):</b> the hidden, deeper, or superior understanding of the situation —
                            usually shared by the ironist and the observer (if able to perceive it).</li>
                    </ol>

                    <p>The presence of both levels is essential: irony does not correct falsehood but <b>exposes two
                            realities simultaneously</b>.</p>

                    <p>Muecke’s classification distinguishes two main forms of irony based on their <b>origin</b>:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Verbal Irony:</b> a figure of speech in which the intended meaning contrasts with the
                            literal one. It implies an ironist who deliberately constructs this opposition.</li>
                        <li><b>Situational Irony:</b> when the outcome of events contradicts expectations or intentions,
                            producing a figurative sense of incongruity.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>He further refines verbal irony through <b>four modes</b>, depending on the ironist’s
                        relationship with their own irony:</p>

                    <ol>
                        <li><b>Impersonal Irony:</b> The irony lies in what is said rather than in who says it; the
                            ironist’s personality remains hidden behind the words.</li>
                        <li><b>Self-disparaging Irony:</b> The ironist adopts a feigned persona (often naive or
                            ignorant) to mask their real opinion and highlight contrast through self-mockery.</li>
                        <li><b>Ingénu Irony (Irony of the Naïf):</b> A naive or innocent narrator exposes societal
                            contradictions through literal and unfiltered observations; the victim is often society
                            itself.</li>
                        <li><b>Dramatized Irony:</b> The ironist disappears almost completely behind the narrative
                            world, allowing irony to emerge from the structure itself, through contradictions embedded
                            in the story.</li>
                    </ol>

                    <p>In addition, Muecke identifies <b>five types of situational irony</b>, based on the nature of the
                        contradiction involved:</p>

                    <ol>
                        <li><b>Irony of Simple Incongruity:</b> Arises from the juxtaposition of parallel incidents or a
                            striking, self-evident incongruity.</li>
                        <li><b>Irony of Events:</b> When an outcome is contrary to what was intended or expected (e.g.,
                            <i>Oedipus</i> ensuring his fate by trying to escape it).
                        </li>
                        <li><b>Dramatic Irony:</b> When the audience knows something the characters do not, creating a
                            gap in awareness.</li>
                        <li><b>Irony of Self-betrayal:</b> When an individual’s actions aimed at a goal unintentionally
                            destroy or contradict that goal.</li>
                        <li><b>Irony of Dilemma (Double Irony):</b> A complex form in which equally valid or invalid
                            terms oppose each other, leaving no superior “reality level” to resolve the tension; it
                            often manifests as paradox or moral ambiguity.</li>
                    </ol>

                    <p>Muecke’s structured typology provided the <b>hierarchical and relational foundation</b> of
                        different kinds of irony within our
                        ontology. The <b>two-level structure</b> at its core,<i>appearance versus reality</i>, is
                        further developed and refined through the framework proposed by <b>Palacio</b>, which
                        deepens the relational and cognitive aspects of irony.</p>

                                    target="_blank">Palacio</a>'s POV</b></i>
                    </h4>
                    <p>Much like Muecke, Palacio aims to find the underlying construction and essence of irony. She
                        uncovers this by performing a meta-analysis from a variety of creative mediums such as
                        literature, television and movies. By extracting examples of irony from a wide array of
                        real-world examples (as opposed to made-up instances), Palacio manages to piece together common
                        patterns in order to extract a <b>generalised structure of irony</b>.</p>

                    <p>Palacio explains how irony is the product of a <b>clash</b> between an <b>epistemic</b>
                        <b>scenario</b> created by an <b>ironist</b> and an <b>observable</b> <b>scenario</b> perceived
                        by an <b>interpreter</b>.
                    </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Epistemic Scenario</b> - The expectation held about a certain set of circumstances. </li>
                        <li><b>Observable Scenario</b> - What is actually happening in an observed set of circumstances.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Palacio goes into more detail of these scenarios in verbal irony, further breaking down the
                        construction of a verbal epistemic scenario into <b>pretended agreement, ironic markers and
                            echo-building</b> (repeating something related to the pretended agreement).</p>

                    <p>But what we can see from the most general definition of irony, is the parallel to <b>Muecke’s
                            principle of duality</b> with the epistemic as the appearance and the observable as the
                        reality. Palacio builds upon this by highlighting the importance of the “clash” between these
                        two ideas as the place where irony is actually born. As she explains, <i>“there is no ironic
                            meaning until an interpreter, or a perceiver, detects a clash between two scenarios”</i>
                        (Lozano Palacio, 2020, p. 93). This not only emphasises the <b>communicative nature of irony</b>
                        but also highlights how the interpreter perceives the clash is another fundamental part to the
                        construction of irony.</p>

                    <p>Follow on from this, Palacio introduces a third element of irony, the target, or rather the
                        object of the ironic instance. The target can vary from the actors involved in the irony, to a
                        political ideology. For this she identifies <b>four broad target types, a person, a state of
                            affairs, an institution or any animate or inanimate object</b>. For our ontology we extended
                        this to seven types, a community, a concept, an institution, a person, the self, a state of
                        affairs or a thing.</p>

                    <p>Placing these perspectives into the context of our ontology, we modeled irony as the <b>product
                            of an event</b> involving an epistemic scenario and an observable scenario which clash with
                        each other. This event is <b>created by an ironist</b>, and <b>perceived by an interpreter</b>.
                        The ironic instance is then <b>targeted</b> at a particular idea. By placing irony as the
                        product of an event we can reveal both its <b>social context and communicative nature</b>.</p>

                    <p>We also wanted to extend these reflections on irony by also highlighting the instances which are
                        created when there is no clash between an epistemic and observable scenario. We have defined
                        these <b>instances as sincerity</b>.</p>

                <div class="about-card">
                    <h3 id="card3"><b>Ironic Creativity</b></h3>
                    <p>Now that we have a structured understanding of irony (and sincerity when there is no clash), we
                        can take a look at its creative nature.</p>

                    <p>In <i><a href="">Analysis of Creativity</a></i>, Mel Rhodes highlights three key qualities of creativity and
                        original ideas:</p>

                    <ol>
                        <li>A <b>human mind</b> grasping the elements of a subject</li>
                        <li><b>Reflection</b> on the <b>parts</b> of the subject, their <b>relationship</b> to each
                            other and to the <b>whole</b></li>
                        <li>A <b>sustained effort</b> in <b>embodying</b> or <b>articulating</b> the idea effectively
                        </li>
                    </ol>

                    <p>These three points reflect the elements needed to make irony successful. On the part of the
                        ironist, before attempting irony, they need to be aware of the <b>common knowledge between
                            themselves and the interpreter</b>, to play with the expectations which arise from that
                        knowledge, because as Palacio and Muecke point out, <b>irony can only come about when the clash
                            between the expectation and reality has been perceived by an interpreter</b>.</p>

                    <p>Rhodes continues to synthesise the essence of creativity by introducing four elements he refers
                        to as the <b>4Ps of creativity - Person, Process, Press, Product</b>.</p>

                    <h4>Person</h4>
                    <p>This refers to all the personal traits that influence a person’s creativity, such as,
                        personality, intellect, value systems, etc. Another aspect of the creative person which Rhodes
                        highlights is <i>“the ability to be puzzled…[and] the ability to accept conflict and
                            tension”</i> (Rhodes, 1961, p. 4). Here we see the qualities of the actors of irony
                        highlighted, particularly that of the <b>interpreter</b>, who is the <b>final actor in this
                            creative process</b>, perceiving a conflict between the epistemic and the observable and
                        therefore fulfilling the ironic idea put forth by the ironist. </p>

                    <h4>Process</h4>
                    <p>Process refers to <b>any act involved in creativity</b>, from thinking and learning to
                        implementing. A key aspect which Rhodes highlights here is that of the <b>process of
                            communicating</b> which aligns with the third key quality of creativity he outlines in the
                        beginning. Creativity is not just a solitary process within the mind of a single creative
                        person, it is rather a <b>manifestation of the interaction and communication between actors and
                            environments</b>. This is particularly true for irony which required both the <b>production
                            of the idea from the ironist</b> as well as the <b>acknowledgement and perception of the
                            idea from the interpreter</b>.</p>

                    <h4>Press</h4>
                    <p>Rhodes uses press to refer to <i>“the relationship between human beings and their
                            environment"</i> (Rhodes, 1961, p. 5). This brings to mind the target or object of an ironic
                        remark. Although the word target may suggest it comes at the end of the ironic process once the
                        irony has been made and perceived, <b>the target actually represents the whole social context in
                            which the irony was created</b>, placing it both at the <b>beginning and end of the ironic
                            process</b>. Like Rhodes explains, <i>“each idea that emerges reflects uniquely upon the
                            originator's self, his sensory equipment, his mentality, his value systems, and his
                            conditioning to the everyday experiences of life”</i> (Rhodes, 1961, p. 5). In the ironic
                        process this extends to making sure that the experiences and value systems of the ironist also
                        somewhat overlap with that of the interpreter.</p>

                    <h4>Product</h4>
                    <p>A product is <b>an idea embodied into a tangible form</b> where <i>“idea refers to a thought
                            which has been communicated to other people in the form of words, paint, clay, metal, stone,
                            fabric, or other material”</i> (Rhodes, 1961, p. 6). In our context the product is the
                        creative work, or more specifically the lyrical work, in which we have found instances of
                        creative ideas in the form of irony and sincerity. By using lyrical works such as poems and
                        songs which are typically shorter than prose and literature, we can study complete works and
                        look at how multiple creative ideas (ironic and sincere) can make up a whole creative product.
                    </p>

                        <li><b>cover:CreativeIdea</b> –> <b>creon:CreativeIdea</b> - it is typically defined as a
                            novel or divergent concept or thought that arises in the mind of an individual and can
                            be communicated to others.</li>
                        <li><b>cover:CreativeWork</b> –> <b>creon:CreativeProduct</b>- It is something that is

                            involves creative processes, ideas, products, persons, contexts, etc.</li>

                    <h3 id="card4"><b>Examples of Irony</b></h3>
                    <p>In our dataset, we included not only poems in the strict sense but also song lyrics (cover:Poem
                        and cover:Song), as irony tends to appear more frequently in the latter. Consequently, the
                        interpreter of potential irony can belong to one of two categories: Reader or Listener. In the
                        case of songs, the performer is not necessarily the author and therefore not always the ironist
                        in the situation. Some instances are not in English and thus include both the original text and
                        its English translation. </p>
                    <p> Within these instances, we identified both ironic and non-ironic expressions, in order to
                        highlight the distinction between the two and to further emphasize the presence of irony when it
                        occurs. An instance is classified as ironic when it displays a duality of meaning—that is, when
                        the Epistemic and Observable scenarios diverge (in practical terms, when the literals, or
                        strings in the dataset, do not align). Conversely, when such a divergence does not occur (when
                        there is no “clash” between what the ironist states and what the observer perceives), the
                        instance is considered sincere, as the absence of this clash indicates that no irony is involved
                        and that the author’s utterance corresponds to their genuine intent.</p>

                    <p>Querying the ontology represents the final step in understanding how our model works in practice.
                        By using <b>SPARQL</b>, we can explore the relationships between concepts and individuals,
                        verify connections between authors, works, and events, and test how irony emerges through
                        different contexts. This process transforms the ontology from a simple conceptual map into an
                        interactive knowledge system — a space where data can be questioned, interpreted, and connected
                        in new and creative ways, much like the dynamics of irony itself.</p>

                    <h3 id="card7"><b>Conclusions</b></h3>
                    <p>The aim of this project was to develop an ontology capable of capturing how irony operates and is
                        constructed within a literary context, a fertile ground where authors can creatively convey
                        meaning without stating it directly, leaving layers of interpretation for the reader to uncover.
                        Irony, in this sense, exists in the tension between what is said and what is meant, a duality
                        that our ontology was designed to represent. This tension forms the core distinction between
                        ironic and non-ironic instances, reflecting the interplay between the Epistemic and the
                        Observable Scenario.
                    </p>

                    <p>In designing our ontology, we ensured that the outcomes of our queries would align with the
                        theoretical frameworks proposed by Muecke and Palacio, as well as established structures of
                        irony. Instances were categorized as either Ironic or Sincere, enabling the ontology to identify
                        and differentiate ironic from non-ironic expressions. This approach allows for a systematic
                        exploration of irony within literary texts, highlighting both explicit and subtle forms.
                    </p>

                    <p>Moreover, the dataset can be further expanded with additional examples to make these distinctions
                        more explicit and robust, improving the ontology’s coverage and applicability. Future work could
                        also explore the integration of context-sensitive features or pragmatic cues, enhancing the
                        system’s ability to model the nuanced mechanisms through which irony is conveyed and
                        interpreted.
                    </p>
