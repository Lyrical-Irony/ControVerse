                                <p>How can irony be defined? It is the art of saying something while meaning its
                                    opposite — a delicate balance between appearance and reality. But irony is also a
                                    deeply <b>creative act</b>: it relies on imagination, interpretation, and shared
                                    understanding between the ironist and the observer. This ontology aims to map that
                                    creative tension, revealing how irony emerges, evolves, and connects minds through
                                    layers of meaning.</p>

                <h2>The Project</h2>
                <p> This project was developed for the course Knowledge Organisation and Extraction by Aldo Gangemi at
                    Alma Mater Studiorum – University of Bologna, within the Master’s Degree in Digital Humanities and
                    Digital Knowledge. It focuses on creativity in irony, exploring how irony can be understood as a
                    creative event emerging from the tacit agreement between the ironist and the interpreter. Through
                    this lens, creativity is not seen as an isolated act of invention, but as a dynamic process of
                    shared understanding — where meaning arises from interaction, context, and the subtle interplay of
                    knowledge, interpretation, and intent.</p>

                    <p>We chose irony as the focus of our project because it is a complex, elusive, and deeply
                        relational concept. What makes it especially intriguing is its inherent <b>duality</b>, the
                        constant coexistence and tension between two layers of meaning: appearance and reality, the
                        literal and the implied. This friction between what is said and what is meant is what we call
                        <b>clash</b>, which becomes a fertile ground for creativity, as it generates new
                        interpretations, perspectives, and connections.
                    </p>
                    <p>Our scope is building an ontology about <b>irony in lyrical works</b> that allows us to make this
                        dual structure visible. Lyrical texts offer an ideal ground for this exploration, as their
                        concise form amplifies the delicate balance between expression and interpretation, allowing us
                        to trace how irony unfolds across different contexts.</p>
                    <p>In this sense, <b>irony is a form of creativity in which both the ironist and the observer
                            participate as co-creators</b>. Irony is not a solitary act but a shared artistic process:
                        its meaning emerges only through the interplay between the one who produces it and the one who
                        perceives it. The ironist shapes the ambiguity, while the observer completes the act by
                        recognizing and interpreting it. This collaborative creation is precisely what makes irony
                        fascinating to represent within an ontology: it is an attempt to map not only the structure of
                        meanings, but also their dynamic relationship that brings creativity to life.</p>

                <!--CARD 2-->
                <div class="about-card">
                    <h3 id="card2"><b>Two POVs</b></h3>
                    <p>Irony is notoriously difficult to define, as it is marked by a strong degree of subjectivity.
                        Attempts to confine such a broad concept within a structured framework have been numerous, yet
                        inevitably reductive. The challenge is particularly acute in literature, where multiple forms of
                        irony have already been contextualized and analyzed by scholars in relation to different
                        authors.</p>
                    <p>Among the various sources we explored to define and abstract the concept of irony, our ontology
                        is primarily based on two closely related works: <b>Muecke’s The Compass of Irony</b> and
                        <b>Inés Lozano-Palacio’s dissertation Modeling Irony</b>, which itself draws heavily on Muecke’s
                        framework. Muecke approaches irony in a structured and general way, unlike many other studies
                        that focus on specific types of irony — such as Socratic or Byronic irony — which tend to be
                        more descriptive, practical, but less conceptually coherent (for example, texts labeled as
                        “Socratic” are not written by Socrates himself, so it would first be necessary to clearly define
                        what actually constitutes “Socratic irony” — and what does not.) For this reason, we sought a
                        more systematic and abstract approach, capable of capturing the underlying mechanisms of irony
                        rather than its manifestations in particular styles or authors.
                    </p>

                    <h4><i>Muecke's POV</i></h4>
                    <p><b>To build the conceptual framework of our ontology</b>, we relied on Muecke’s analytical model
                        of irony, which provided a structured foundation for abstracting and classifying the phenomenon.
                        For Muecke, the <b>ironologist</b> plays a crucial role — their task is not to interpret irony
                        but to <b>simplify, generalize, and formalize</b> it. Irony, described as <i>“the art of saying
                            something without truly saying it”</i>, is an <b>intellectual instrument</b> rather than an
                        emotional one, belonging to the realm of reasoning and reflection.</p>

                    <p>Muecke traces its evolution from a mere rhetorical device to a <b>philosophical attitude</b>, a
                        transformation initiated by German Romanticism at the end of the eighteenth century. From this
                        moment, irony becomes a tool for confronting the contradictions and paradoxes of human
                        existence. As Muecke notes, <i>“irony, like beauty, is in the eye of the beholder”</i> — it
                        depends on an <b>observer with a sense of irony</b>, capable of perceiving the coexistence of
                        two realities.</p>

                    <p>At the core of his framework lies the <b>principle of duality</b>, or <i>“double exposure”</i>,
                        between two levels of meaning:</p>

                    <ol>
                        <li><b>Level 1 (Appearance):</b> the literal meaning, the immediate perception, or the surface
                            intention.</li>
                        <li><b>Level 2 (Reality):</b> the hidden, deeper, or superior understanding of the situation —
                            usually shared by the ironist and the observer.</li>
                    </ol>

                    <p>The presence of both levels is essential: irony does not correct falsehood but <b>exposes two
                            realities simultaneously</b>.</p>

                    <p>Muecke’s classification distinguishes two main forms of irony based on their <b>origin</b>:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Verbal Irony:</b> a figure of speech in which the intended meaning contrasts with the
                            literal one. It implies an ironist who deliberately constructs this opposition.</li>
                        <li><b>Situational Irony:</b> when the outcome of events contradicts expectations or intentions,
                            producing a figurative sense of incongruity.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>He further refines verbal irony through <b>four modes</b>, depending on the ironist’s
                        relationship with their own irony:</p>

                    <ol>
                        <li><b>Impersonal Irony:</b> The irony lies in what is said rather than in who says it; the
                            ironist’s personality remains hidden behind the words.</li>
                        <li><b>Self-disparaging Irony:</b> The ironist adopts a feigned persona (often naive or
                            ignorant) to mask their real opinion and highlight contrast through self-mockery.</li>
                        <li><b>Ingénu Irony (Irony of the Naïf):</b> A naive or innocent narrator exposes societal
                            contradictions through literal and unfiltered observations; the victim is often society
                            itself.</li>
                        <li><b>Dramatized Irony:</b> The ironist disappears almost completely behind the narrative
                            world, allowing irony to emerge from the structure itself, through contradictions embedded
                            in the story.</li>
                    </ol>

                    <p>In addition, Muecke identifies <b>five types of situational irony</b>, based on the nature of the
                        contradiction involved:</p>

                    <ol>
                        <li><b>Irony of Simple Incongruity:</b> Arises from the juxtaposition of parallel incidents or a
                            striking, self-evident incongruity.</li>
                        <li><b>Irony of Events:</b> When an outcome is contrary to what was intended or expected (e.g.,
                            <i>Oedipus</i> ensuring his fate by trying to escape it).
                        </li>
                        <li><b>Dramatic Irony:</b> When the audience knows something the characters do not, creating a
                            gap in awareness.</li>
                        <li><b>Irony of Self-betrayal:</b> When an individual’s actions aimed at a goal unintentionally
                            destroy or contradict that goal.</li>
                        <li><b>Irony of Dilemma (Double Irony):</b> A complex form in which equally valid or invalid
                            terms oppose each other, leaving no superior “reality level” to resolve the tension; it
                            often manifests as paradox or moral ambiguity.</li>
                    </ol>

                    <p>Muecke’s structured typology provided the <b>hierarchical and relational foundation</b> of our
                        ontology, defining irony as a system of contrasts between expression and meaning, intention and
                        perception. The <b>two-level structure</b> at its core — <i>appearance versus reality</i> — is
                        further developed and refined through the framework proposed by <b>Lozano-Palacio</b>, which
                        deepens the relational and cognitive aspects of irony.</p>

                    <p>Querying the ontology represents the final step in understanding how our model works in practice.
                        By using <b>SPARQL</b>, we can explore the relationships between concepts and individuals,
                        verify connections between authors, works, and events, and test how irony emerges through
                        different contexts. This process transforms the ontology from a simple conceptual map into an
                        interactive knowledge system — a space where data can be questioned, interpreted, and connected
                        in new and creative ways, much like the dynamics of irony itself.</p>
