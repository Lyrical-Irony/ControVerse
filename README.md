## 🌍 Overview  
This project was developed for the course **Knowledge Organisation and Extraction** by **Aldo Gangemi** at **Alma Mater Studiorum – University of Bologna**, within the **Master’s Degree in Digital Humanities and Digital Knowledge**.  

The ontology explores the relationship between **irony and creativity**, framing irony as a *creative event* that arises from the tacit agreement between the **ironist** and the **interpreter**. Rather than treating creativity as an isolated act of invention, the project views it as a **dynamic process of shared understanding**, where meaning is continuously negotiated through interaction, context, and intent.   

## 💡 Concept  
**What is irony?**  
Irony is the art of saying something while meaning its opposite — a subtle play between appearance and reality 🎭. It is a communicative act that depends on **context**, **knowledge**, and **interpretation**.  

From this perspective, irony becomes a **creative phenomenon**:  
- ✨ It engages imagination and interpretation.  
- 🧠 It depends on mutual understanding between the speaker and the observer.  
- 💬 It produces new meanings through tension and ambiguity.  

The ontology aims to **map this creative tension**, illustrating how irony emerges, evolves, and connects minds through overlapping layers of meaning.
